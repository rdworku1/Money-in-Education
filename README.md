How state per pupil funding affects student performance

We are looking at state per pupil funding for public schools for every state in the U.S. The purpose of this observational study is to see if school funding for students is in fact equitable. We believe that state per pupil funding and the average income of students may have a relationship with student performance on state standardized scores. This information is important because it can impact the academic progress and the resources available for many students. Looking at per pupil funding per student hints at the disparity between public schools in the United States and the results of that disparity. It can help reveal the systemic discrimination behind the U.S. education system. 

Response Variable:
Average Test score(Continuous quantitative); (0 to 500 Points) The response variable will be the performance score (0 to 500 points) on the Math and ELA tests.
Explanatory Variables:
Type of test (Nominal categorical): This variable categorizes the test score by type, either Math or English Language Arts. This variable is based off of data. 
Average amount of funding per student by each state (Continuous quantitative): This variable is looking at the funding per student given by the state for a year. This will be measured with online data. It will be in number dollars. 
Amount of average household income for each state (Continuous quantitative): This variable is looking at the average household income for each state. It will be measured with online data and it will be in number dollars.
Amount of students (Discrete quantitative): This variable is a count of how many students are within a states’ education system. 
Population: We are generalizing the education system in the US by looking at each state. Our sample population is on the states in the US. We will be looking at the amount of funds per each student provided by each state and the average test score within each state’s student population.
